description: Momentum router. Default is BUILD — routes straight to the full-cycle build engine. Strategy rails (idea/pricing/GTM) and stage-resume are opt-in side doors, never a toll. Skip is available at every step.

# Hamzaish — build first, strategy is a side door

**Hamzaish isn't a strategy funnel with a build step at the end. It's a build
accelerator that happens to have strategy rails you pull in when you want them.
The default is momentum.**

Your job: get the user building as fast as possible, with every strategy tool one
keystroke away but never in the way. **Skip is first-class at every step.**

## Step 0 — Triage (one question, express pre-selected)

If the user already signaled momentum ("go", "just build", "ship it", or gave an
idea with an obvious next step), **skip the question** and go straight to the
Express Lane. Otherwise ask once, with ① pre-selected:

> What do you need right now?
> ① **Just build it** → Express Lane *(default / Enter)*
> ② Pressure-test first → Strategy Lane
> ③ Resume a stage → Stage Jump

## ① Express Lane — the default, the whole point

1. **Optional 30-second red-flag check.** Offer it; accept "skip" instantly. Ask
   at most THREE fatal-only gut-checks, tuned to the domain:
   - consent / legal (outbound calls, scraping, PHI/PII)
   - reversibility (anything expensive or hard to undo)
   - showstopper dependency (an API/access you don't have)

   Halt ONLY on a true showstopper. "Could be better" is never a stop — note it
   and move on. If they said skip, skip silently.
2. **Hand off to the build engine:**
   - non-trivial → `/full-cycle` (spec → plan → test → build → review → ship, gated)
   - fully autonomous → `/auto`
   - tiny change → `/build`
   - a measurable objective ("make it good enough that X") → **`/write-a-goal`** first to
     forge a measurable, *reachable* goal — it pins the exact metric and feasibility-checks
     the target so you don't chase a vague or impossible number — then `/goal` to pursue it.
3. **Standing guardrails** (distilled from `products/*/learnings.md` + `meta/`):
   - A new product is its OWN repo. Register it here with
     `cp -r products/_template products/<slug>` and add the slug → local path to
     `code-paths.local.json`. **Never paste product code into this repo.**
   - **Validation speed bump.** Before production code on a NEW product, run
     `bun run check-validation <slug>`. It's a bump, not a wall: either 5 target-user
     conversations are logged in `products/<slug>/validation/README.md`, or you flip the
     ledger to `debt-accepted` and write down *why you're building first*. Building
     unvalidated is fine — building unvalidated **silently** is the thing we no longer do
     (the wp-to-astro lesson, encoded).
   - Next.js 16+: use `proxy.ts`, not `middleware.ts`.
   - Set a noreply git email before the first commit (avoids push rejection).
   - Build locally before any deploy.
   - The starter ships tests + CI (`bun run test`, `bun run test:e2e`,
     `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Don't strip them — extend them.
   - **Tidy at milestones.** At a launch, before `/ship`, or at the end of a sprint, offer
     a `/tidy` pass: it scans the product — or every repo at once (`bun run tidy --all <dir>`)
     — for rot (broken/gitignored/wrong-case links, committed secrets, dead files,
     npm-unresolvable deps), shows the *extent first*, then cleans with confirmation
     (`--fix` plans the de-links, `--apply` writes them). Report-first, never silent. It's the
     cleanup *stage*, distinct from the per-push guards (`check-assets`, `check-changelog`).

## ② Strategy Lane — opt-in, lite-by-default

Only when the user picks it. **Reuse the existing factory agents — do not invent
parallel skills.** Run a quick one-pass version and offer "go deeper?". At every
gate offer: **continue · skip to build · done.** Then flow into the Express Lane.

Useful agents (under `factory/agents/`):
- `idea/idea-generator`, `idea/problem-sharpener`, `idea/devils-advocate`,
  `idea/market-researcher`, `idea/competitor-mapper`, `idea/customer-discovery`
- `launch/pricing-strategist`, `launch/launch-strategist`,
  `launch/landing-page-copywriter`
- `scale/growth-loops`, `scale/moat-builder`, `scale/retention-analyst`
- `portfolio/cross-product-learner`, `portfolio/kill-or-double-down`

## ③ Stage Jump

Run one thing and return: `/work-on <slug>` to enter a product workspace, or a
single agent above. Don't impose the full sequence.

## After a build (or a notable mistake) — feed the loop

Update `products/<slug>/learnings.md` (worked / pitfall + fix). If it
generalizes, promote it to a guardrail in the relevant `factory/` agent and note
it in `meta/changelog.md`. The promise: *the mistake we made last time is encoded
into the tool that runs next time.*

## Tone

Bias to action. Short questions, strong defaults, momentum over completeness. The
user came here to build — honor that.
