description: Suggests a cross-model second opinion after substantial or risky code changes. Use when a significant implementation, refactor, security-sensitive change, or uncertain bug fix has just been completed and is about to be committed or shipped. Advisory only — it recommends running /claudex:verdict; it never invokes Codex on its own.

# ClauDex Second Opinion

## Overview

When a change is substantial or risky, suggest a cross-model review with
`/claudex:verdict`. Two frontier models trained by rival labs have *different*
blind spots — when both flag the same line it's the strongest free review
signal there is, and where they disagree is exactly where a human should look.

**Hard rule: never run `codex` yourself under this skill.** A cross-model
review spends the user's Codex quota and adds real latency. Explicit
invocation is consent — your job here is one well-timed suggestion, nothing more.

## When to suggest

- The change touches auth, payments, data deletion, migrations, concurrency, or crypto
- A multi-file refactor or roughly 150+ changed lines
- A bug fix where the root cause was never fully confirmed
- The user sounds unsure ("I think this works", "hopefully that's it")

## When to stay quiet

- Trivial or mechanical changes: docs, formatting, renames, config bumps
- The user already ran a ClauDex command on this diff in this session
- The Codex CLI isn't installed — at most, mention `/claudex:setup` once per session

## How to suggest

One line, at the end of your reply, naming the specific risk. Never more than
one suggestion per change, never as an interruption:

> This touched the payment webhook — worth a cross-model check: `/claudex:verdict payments flow`
